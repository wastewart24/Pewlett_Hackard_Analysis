# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
A clinet from Pewlett Hackard wants me to perform an analysis on employee data and determine which employees will be retiring soon and who can potentially be promoted through a mentorship program in order to replace those that will be leaving. Two tables will be created that will determine which employees were born betwwen 1952-1955 and then which employees born in 1965 and could eligible for the mentorship program.

## Results

### Retirement Titles Table
It was determined that over 30% of the company are eligible for retirement. The majority of those employees work as a Senior Engineer or Senior Staff as seen below in Figure 1.

### Employees Eligible for Mentorship Program
After creating a table of employees born in 1965, only about 1,900 are eligible for the mentorship program in order to be promoted. This is significantly less that the amount of employees that are eligible for retirement.

## Summary
Pewlett Hackard is facing a "silver tsunami" as many of its employees are reaching retirement age. The number of employees who are eligible for the proposed mentorship program is signifcanlty smaller than the number of employees who could retire soon. Management at the company must make decisions on how to fill the shortage of employees at the company over the next decade.
